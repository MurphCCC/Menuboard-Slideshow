# Menuboard-Slideshow
A small package to run a fullscreen jquery slider with various effects.  This is a fork of https://github.com/pixedelic/Camera modified to better suite our digital signage needs.  I have tested this using kweb3 on a Raspberry Pi model 2 and model 3.  Kweb3 works much better than any other browser that I have tried when it comes to running webkit animations.  The effects and timing can be adjusted by editing scripts/camera.js and is very well documented.
